==========

Things that need to be done:
    [ ] Pagination added to all map requests
    [ ] Refactoring to make everything consistent
        A map objects mapid is sometimes used as a string, sometimes an int
    [ ] Login for map ownership
    [ ] Map versioning for multiple maps of same name
    [ ] Enhanced map upload page - if things are missing, let users add them
        If there's no description, let users add it on the upload page
    [ ] check filetypes, size limits, basically a tagpromaplint

The current URLs that are processed

/ -> GET: return showmaps.html rendered with recent_maps
     POST: upload map to database, maybe generate testlink, maybe go to show_map page

/upload -> definitely doesn't do upload thing
/showmap?mapid=MAPID -> Render showmap.html with map given by mapid
/search?query=QUERY -> Search database for query, returning results
/a/<author> -> show maps given by author (case insensitive)
/m/<author>/<mapname> -> show map by author with mapname, selecting the first map
                         I'm not sure if this takes the lowest or the highest mapid
/download?mapname=MAPNAME&mapid=MAPID&filetype=FILETYPE ->
                        Download mapid.filetype and use mapname.filetype for download
# TODO: ensure /m/<a>/<m> takes the most recent map
